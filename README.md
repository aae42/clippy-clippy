ðŸ“Ž for your ðŸ“‹.

Sends images on your clipboard to a vision AI model for transcription into
text.

## vibecoded

Use at your own risk, this was almost entirely vibe-coded.
I had to tweak a bunch of things to get it to work on macos,
but after that was done it compiled for windows on WSL first try ðŸ™€.

I don't know rust very well, and I like learning programming languages by
modifying existing codebases.
This is also a tool I'll likely use frequently,
which increases the probability that I'll be delving into the source and
making adjustments.

## improvements

The configuration system is ALMOST what I want, but works well enough.
It's totally useable as an existing tool, so i'll use it for a while before
I decide what improvements it might need.
